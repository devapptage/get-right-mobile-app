## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. Font Asset Error
- ❌ **Problem:** `EnraSans-Bold.ttf` was missing
- ✅ **Fixed:** Using Inter font as fallback
- ✅ **Result:** App builds successfully

### 2. Auth Controller
- ❌ **Problem:** Entire controller was commented out
- ✅ **Fixed:** Uncommented and simplified for static screens
- ✅ **Result:** Auth flow works perfectly (no API needed)

### 3. API Dependencies
- ❌ **Problem:** Code was trying to use non-existent backend
- ✅ **Fixed:** Removed all API dependencies
- ✅ **Result:** Everything works with local storage only
